# Customer_Churn
The idea behind the project is to predict which customers will churn and decide whether to assign an account manager to that customer or not. 
Note: The account_managers in customer_churn.csv are randomly assigned, therefore did not include that feature in our training model.
Achieved an AUC of 81% on Logistic Regression model. 
The code was written in DataBricks Notebook.
